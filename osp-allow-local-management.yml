# this is an example of how to modify the settings of a running cluster
# the ALLOW_LOCAL_RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT flag in /etc/tower/settings.py on the controller
# controls the ability to update users/orgs/credentials via the api
# you might want to disable that after deployment
# disable by settings the values below to False
# then running 'oc apply -f ./osp-allow-local-management.yml'
#
# there is no need to run this as is. 
# It is included with deployment config in templates/deploy-aap25-cluster.yml.j2
